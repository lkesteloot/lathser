To do next:
    - Fix raster output.
        - Try bi-directional.
    - Cut both sides:
        - 0
        - 180
        - 180 + 1/16
        - 0 + 1/16
        - ...
    - Get zero point correct.
    - Try DNA.
    - Write simulator of cuts as a web page.
    - Increase kerf to get better ears.
    - Try output from ctrl-cut.
        - http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/print.html#win32print
    - When lighting, sort back-to-front (painter's algorithm).
    - When lighting, rotate normal.
    - Add cut lines to let smaller pieces fall off. Not sure how to do this.
      Could try doing it at the raster layer (by drawing radial lines to the
      edges) but that might leave artifacts on the edge of the piece.

Parts of system:

    - Model importer.
    - Path generator with parameters.
    - PRN file exporter.
    - PRN downloader to printer.
    - Rotation schedule downloader to Arduino.

Notes:

    - Convert model with: http://www.greentoken.de/onlineconv/
        - Make JSON output.

    - To forward ports from hitch to local:
        - Add this to /etc/ssh/sshd_config on server:
            # LK: Allow ssh to forward ports.
            GatewayPorts clientspecified
        - Then locally:
            ssh -R :8000:localhost:8000 lk@hitch.headcode.com
        - Then hit:
            http://hitch.headcode.com:8000/lathser/

            - Simplify list of points by eliminating points that are within epsilon
                of a simpler line sequence.
        - http://outliner.codeplex.com/
            - Has several DOC files for documentation, but I don't have a high-level
              idea of how it works.
        - https://code.google.com/p/shapelogic/wiki/vectorization
            - Not much info. Preferred algorithm is: "The main idea is that
              this will read a whole multi line at a time. Then later it will
              split it according to max distance of pixels to the line between
              start and end point of the multi line."

            - Generate four vectors for each pixel that's on.
            - Remove pairs of identical pixels.
            - Coalesce co-linear vectors.
        - Proposal:
            - For every pixel:
                - If different horizontally or vertically, insert edge.
            - Start with any edge, find connecting edge and link into a list.
            - Run simplification algorithm.
            - Generate SVG with points.
